# Profitable-App-Profiles

This repository is a Dataquest Guided Project covering Python Fundamentals in Data Science. The `Profitable Apps from the App Store and Google Play Store` is a Jupyter Notebook that gives convenient access to the website where original data sets, `AppStore.csv` and `googleplaystore.csv`, were downloaded. It demonstrates how to import, explore, and prepare data. Frequency tables are built to answer the objective of this analysis.
